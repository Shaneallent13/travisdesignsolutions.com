          <h2>Rock-In-Land Speedway</h2>
          <img class="d-block img-fluid border-btm" src="img/borderbottom.svg">
          <p>Rock-In-Land Speedway was created as a lore friendly paid mod for game servers on FiveM, the official Rockstar Games owned modification platform for GTA V. 
            Rock-In-Land was named for its unique infield terrain consisting or multiple rock formations. The "official" sponsor of the speedway is an an-game company titled You Tool, a DIY superstore in the GTA universe providing for a blue and orange color scheme scene throughout the track and buildings. The Speedway and its surrounding area were created to provide players
            with a lore friendly race track as well as a large parking lot for car meets and other group activities. In addition to the parking lot there are several additional buildings and areas,
            such as the mini oval/infield combo version for go karting. There is a main office building that includes an interior, a side garage for storage, a main concessions area with access to the grand stands for players to sepctate, and access to the box seats.
            The race track consists of two routes, the outside oval, and the infield/roval course. The infield of the oval also includes a pit-lane, sponsor tents, and other buildings for players and servers to use.

            <br><br>
            To construct this compound I chose a location in the map that was mostly empty and would not require editing of existing objects to achieve. Through the use of 3rd party tools
            I was able to extract existing map elements and reconstruct the area within Blender to begin my additions. For the layout I was heavily inspired by The Charlotte Motor Speedway and its roval course.
            Due to the nature of GTA V physics and its much lower vehicle top speed compared to  its irl counterparts I decided a much smaller and more compact layout would serve my purposes much better. 
            I first began by constructing the geometry needed for the banking itself, using my own custom banking construction methods developed over years of experience. After the banking was
            complete I planned and constructed the supporting structures and buildings. To keep the map aas aestheticly similar to existing gta structures as I could I re-used most materials from
            existing structures and locations on the GTA V Map.

        <p>The Senora National Motorpark is a fictional area created for GTA V custom servers featuring a full grand
          prix circuit, karting track, drag strip, and drift course.
          The motorpark also includes parking lots for car meets in multiple locations, vending and rest areas, as well
          as a main office and administrative building. The paved track areas are custom designed in Blender then added
          to the existing
          game files and blended with its surroundings for an immersive game style. The grand prix portion features
          several banked turns, a mix of track surfaces, several custom built environment props and buildings, and
          custom lighting for racing any time day or night
          <br><br>
          The Senora National Motorpark also feratures an arcade style Karts track located at the administrative
          building. Behind the Kart track is the dragstrip area for 1/4 mile acceleration and top speed competitions as
          well as grandstands for spectators.
          <br><br>
          The Mount Lion Drift Track is situated adjacent to the drag strip on the elevated hill area. Named for the in
          game mountain lion that nests on top the hill throughout the day, the Mount Lion Drift Track features its own
          parking lot for car meets of more than 30+ potential players.

        <h2>GTA V Gamemode Maps</h2>
        <img class="d-block img-fluid border-btm" src="img/borderbottom.svg">
        <p>Sumo is a game mode within Grand Theft Auto V in which players try to force eachother off of the map area
          with the last person or team alive being the winner.
          The first map for these game mode is the Qube, which is a giant cube in the sky that rotates as players
          progress, creating a challening environment for all drivers.
          The second map for sumo is the giant funnel which has a big funnel area in the middle for drivers to navigate,
          as well as spawn areas for teams and players around the outside, and a top area with a jump centered in the
          middle to allow up to 60 players to spread out a little bit as the match progresses.
          <br><br>
          The third map made for this game mode is named Turtle Island, an island themed map situated of of the
          coastline that happens to be shaped like a turtle.
          The goal of this map was to create a play area with a wide variety of terrain with different traction
          properties. The main islands are grass with a small tarmac road through the center.
          The raised wooden platforms circle around each players spawn and also have a four way crossover jump in the
          middle providing for a tight path with plenty of routes to choose from. On the turtles "head" area is a rock
          hill for players to be able to climb and ramp off of as well.
