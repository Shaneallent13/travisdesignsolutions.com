        <p>The Senora National Motorpark is a fictional area I created for GTA V custom servers featuring a full grand
          prix circuit, karting track, drag strip, and drift course.
          The motorpark also includes parking lots for car meets in multiple locations, vending and rest areas, as well
          as a main office and administrative building. The paved track areas are custom designed in Blender then added
          to the existing
          game files and blended with its surroundings for an immersive game style. The grand prix portion features
          several banked turns, a mix of track surfaces, several custom built environment props and buildings, and
          custom lighting for racing any time day or night
          <br><br>
          The Senora National Motorpark also feratures an arcade style Karts track located at the administrative
          building. Behind the Kart track is the dragstrip area for 1/4 mile acceleration and top speed competitions as
          well as grandstands for spectators.
          <br><br>
          The Mount Lion Drift Track is situated adjacent to the drag strip on the elevated hill area. Named for the in
          game mountain lion that nests on top the hill throughout the day, the Mount Lion Drift Track features its own
          parking lot for car meets of more than 30+ potential players.

        <img class="d-block img-fluid border-btm" src="img/borderbottom.svg" alt="Uthappizza">
        <p>Sumo is a game mode within Grand Theft Auto V in which players try to force eachother off of the map area
          with the last person or team alive being the winner.
          The first map for these game mode is the Qube, which is a giant cube in the sky that rotates as players
          progress, creating a challening environment for all drivers.
          The second map for sumo is the giant funnel which has a big funnel area in the middle for drivers to navigate,
          as well as spawn areas for teams and players around the outside, and a top area with a jump centered in the
          middle to allow up to 60 players to spread out a little bit as the match progresses.
          <br><br>
          The third map made for this game mode is named Turtle Island, an island themed map situated of of the
          coastline that happens to be shaped like a turtle.
          The goal of this map was to create a play area with a wide variety of terrain with different traction
          properties. The main islands are grass with a small tarmac road through the center.
          The raised wooden platforms circle around each players spawn and also have a four way crossover jump in the
          middle providing for a tight path with plenty of routes to choose from. On the turtles "head" area is a rock
          hill for players to be able to climb and ramp off of as well.
